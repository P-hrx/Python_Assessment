It increases the visibility of your products and helps you to reach a larger customer base. It brings your products under the spotlight, provides more visibility and boosts your sales. Check out the video below to know more></p>

<p> 3. Good packaging:

   The look and feel of your product, when it is delivered to the customer, has a major impact on buyer experience. Packing products with good packaging material minimises the chances of in-transit damage. But more than that, it reflects quality service and increases buyers’ trust in you and your brand, which in turn, can increase your sales. We have observed that 52% of buyers make repeat purchases from sellers who deliver premium packaging, and 5% of buyers expect their online orders to arrive in premium packaging. Investing in packaging can result in a gain of 30% more sale.></p>



<p> 4. Better cataloging:

   Your catalog represents your product on the e-commerce website and plays a prime role in influencing buyers. Having a well-crafted catalog with a crisp description of your products is crucial to convert the traffic on your products into sales. Remember, most people shop online to save time and your product description should impress them without making them spend much time trying to understand your product. Another important element of cataloging that can help you increase your sales is adding your product in the right category and sub-category. This will help buyers search for your products easily and contribute to the traffic.></p>

  Inventory is an important part of any retail business and e-commerce is no different. You should always have a sufficient stock of items and different variants of your products to fulfill orders faster and do more business. Stocking up also keeps you ready for a shopping festival at any moment.></p>



<P> 7. Deliver on time:

If you want to increase your sales, you must always meet the buyers’ expectation–– whether it is the quality of the product or time taken to deliver it. Keep products ready for delivery and mark them RTD (Ready to Dispatch) on time to help our logistics partners deliver your products in the quickest time possible. Fulfilling a return or exchange request on time is just as important too to get good customer ratings and reviews.
